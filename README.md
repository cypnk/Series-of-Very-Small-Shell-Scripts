# Series of Very Small Shell Scripts
Or go away or I will replace you with a very small shell script

This is a collection of scripts I use to help me host a number of  
websites, as well as several hidden services, including my blog.

These help me renew TLS certificates via Let's Encrypt, perform quick  
backups to USB sticks, rollover access and error logs and some other  
housekeeping tasks.

These scripts are specific to OpenBSD, but some of them can be adapted  
for other operating systems.

Remember to set `chmod +x script.sh` on these if you want to run these  
on a schedule.
